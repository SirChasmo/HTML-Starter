Here is a ZIP file for starting your first HTML website.

(After you download the HTML-Starter-main.zip file)
1. Open the html-starter.zip
2. Make a folder in a seperate location, copy everything from the ZIP file and paste it into the folder
3. Open the folder in any Code Editor (Visual Studio or VS Code recommended)

P.S. the index.html file is where you begin coding your HTML
